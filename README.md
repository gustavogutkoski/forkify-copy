# forkify-copy
Repository for remake of some project I've made when doing some JS courses. Feel free to contribute.

In this project, I'll be using webpack for learning to work with some modular JS and Babel for transpilling ESNext to ES5 for working with all browsers or something like this.

The idea is to redo the forkify project to fix the knowledge obtained about ES6 and work with modular JS with webpack.
The HTML and CSS files were copied from the original project because I focused on learning JavaScript and modern tools for web developing.

The course I've made is the "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!" and I've bought in Udemy.

All the JS files will be in PT-BR for making easy to me to learn the functions, hehe.

Feel free to contribute or suggest something that may help me for learning some new methods for JavaScript developing.
